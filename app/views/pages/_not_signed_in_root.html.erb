    <!-- <div class="col-sm-6 learning-step">
      <p>As technology gets better and the get more accessible. But at the end of the day the best way to learn is still being able to interact, ask questions, etc. with someone with more knowledge than you.</p>

      <p>For us chess players that can be frustrating. Having to find someone better than you, decently close, squeeze them into your schedule, and hopefully have the money to pay for it.</p>

      <p>Goodbye to those days. ChessExplained is a place where you can do all you need on the internet. Upload games and simply invite anyone you want to review your game. Learning chess has never been so easy.</p>

      <p>I love chess. I've been playing the game competitively since I was 5 years old.</p>

      <!-- <p>While playing and trying to get better every day I realized how hard it was to surround yourself in an environment to learn chess. It really hit me when my friend Jack Hanson and I went off to different states for college. I was actually the coach instead of the student this time around. I would review Hanson's games a few times a week, answer questions he had, and help him get better. When we went to school and weren't physically with eachother it was impossible to review his games and teach him.</p> -->

      <p>I've had a vision for ChessExplained for years, and since <%= link_to "learning how to code", "https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3771-jack-mallers-from-dropout-to-starter", target: "_blank" %> I'm that much closer to building that vision. This is my first version, and I'm <%= link_to "in the process of rebuilding", announcement_url %> a more robust platform that better supports my goal of changing the way we experience the game of chess.</p>

      <p>In the meantime I hope you find this site useful, and I would love to hear your feedback. Feel free to hit me up @jackmallers or jimmymowschess@gmail.com to schedule a time to chat and review some games.</p>
